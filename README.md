# Grazioso-Salvare
CRUD Database application that utilizes MongoDB and Plotly Dash to populate a Table, Pie Chart, and Map with Information.

<h3>
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
</h3>
<p>
The easiest way to write any code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to write code <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming">modularly</a>. In doing so, you make sure that any use of your code is able to change based on the needs of the user. In this project, I wrote the code modularly and did not get to write any constructors, as it did not need any constructors. While constructors are not the catch-all, they allow your code to be very useful for whatever you may be doing. The advantages to this is being able to easily read and edit the code that you have provided.</a>

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
</h3>
<p>
The best way to approach a problem as a computer science is to assume that there is a problem that can be solved. I find it best to identify the problem before trying to work on the problem at hand. The problem faced by the work that I had to complete for Grazioso Salvare can be summarized in a few sentences. 
  <p>There needs to be a database.</p>
  <p>There needs to be a way to CRUD a database.</p>
  <p>People will use this application</p>
Seeing as this was what needed to be done, it was simple to assume that we would need to use something that could show our users information. This makes it easier for the user and the programmer. In doing so, we deduced we would need to use a database to store all of the information that will be processed.
</p>
<p>
With this information at our disposal we would choose what tools we need. In this case, it is Python and Plotly Dash. With these tools we delivered a program that is completely functional for both the user and morular for the programmer. In the future, the use of Databases will be how we store any information that may be needed for applications. Through the use of any SQL or NoSQL language that can be used/interfaced with the language of our choice.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

<a href="https://www.mtu.edu/cs/what/#:~:text=Computer%20scientists%20design%2C%20develop%2C%20and,human%20component%20to%20computer%20science.">Computer Science</a> is a huge topic. We Computer Scientists solve problems. That is what it boils down to. We use technology to advance the users of the internet perceive said information on the internet. I believe that computer scientists will not be going anywhere soon. Even with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> on the rise, we computer scientists will prevail. Though, not having to work as hard and using AI to do my job would not be so bad. As it currently stands, AI is not enought to complete jobs, but assists anyone that is involved in Computer Science.

Computer Science will help companies like Grazioso Salvare to achieve their goals of widening their efforts to find workers for their cause. This will expand their search efforts by a magnitude of times. Computer Science is here to help.
